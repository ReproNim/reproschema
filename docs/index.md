## How to use this documentation

- If you want to know more about the ReproSchema project, its goals and the problems
it tries to solve: check out our [introduction](./01_introduction.md).

- The ReproSchema is related to the `Semantic Web` and relies on `linked data`
and the `JSON-LD` format. If you are unfamiliar with such things, head over to
our [FAQ](./98_FAQ.md). You do not need an in depth understanding of what those
things are to use the ReproSchema but some "big picture" conceptual understanding
could save you from a lot of confusion. 😉

- Not sure how the project is organized? Check out the [project structure](./20_project_structure.md)
page.
