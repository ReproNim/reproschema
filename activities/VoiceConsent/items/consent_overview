The purpose of this study is to look for patterns over time. If you join the study, we will ask you to complete study activities on the study mobile app for 2 weeks every three months. We would like you to participate for 2 years, but you can participate as long as you like. You may not directly benefit from taking part but you may help researchers better understand variations in symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). We expect the risks of participating in this research to be low. Seeing trends in your data may be interesting to you. It may also cause a range of emotions.</p>\n\n      <p>mPower Progression research study was developed by Sage Bionetworks (a not-for-profit research organization). The Principal Investigator for this study is Lara Mangravite, Ph.D. If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about this study please contact the Study Team at +1.833-SAGEBIO (toll-free) or email at PDApp@sagebase.org.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"what-is-involved\">\n      <h3>What Is Involved</h3>\n\n      <p>We will ask you to download the free study app to your phone. In the app, we will ask you questions about your health and your medical history. We will also ask you to complete the simple activities described below. These questions and activities are important for the research study.</p>\n       \n      <p>We will ask you to do:</p>\n      <ul>\n          <li><b>Health survey:</b> Answer a few questions one time (5-minutes) </li>\n          <li><b>Activities:</b> Daily for 14 days every three months (10-minutes):\n              <ul>\n                  <li>Track your symptoms, triggers and medications. </li>\n                  <li>Walk and/or stand still with your phone in your pocket. This is to measure your gait and balance.</li>\n                  <li>Tap on your phone’s screen with your fingers. This is to measure your tapping speed and coordination.</li>\n                  <li>Play a short memory game. To learn more about your memory and thinking.</li>\n                  <li>Hold your phone for 10-15 seconds. This is to measure tremor in your hand.</li>\n              </ul>\n          </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Some study activities need your phone’s sensors to be turned on. For example we use the phone’s GPS to calculate how far you travel while completing the walking activity. We do not use the GPS to find out your exact location. We also use the gyroscope to measure your gait. In addition to collecting data while you use the study app, we will ask you whether we can collect data passively each time your phone sensors are activated outside of the study app. This is to see if the measurements are different when you are doing the mPower app activities or doing normal daily activities. During passive data collection, the sensors will only be collecting data on your movement and on your finger tapping. We will not know your exact location or what you are typing on your phone. You can participate in the mPower progression study even if you do not agree to the passive data collection. You can enable or disable this passive data collection function in the mPower app at any time.</p>\n\n      <p>If you participated previously in the mPower v1.0 study, you will have the option to link your existing mPower data to this study.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"data-collection\">\n      <h3>Data Collection, Storage, and Privacy</h3>\n\n      <p>Your privacy is important to us. We will make every effort to protect your privacy. We will process your data electronically.</p>\n\n      <p>The data we collect through the app is encrypted on the phone. This means your data is protected. Unauthorized people cannot easily understand your data when it is encrypted.</p>\n      \n      <p>We will separate the account information that identifies you from your study data. Your account information will not be stored with your survey responses or app measurements.</p>\n\n      <p>Instead of using your name or information that directly identifies you, we will create a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for you. This code cannot be used to directly identify you. We will use your GUID instead of your name alongside your data. Only key people from our study team can link your identity to your study data.</p>\n\n      <p>We will combine your coded study data with the coded study data of other volunteers.</p>\n\n      <p>We will transfer this combined coded study data on the cloud-based Synapse data analysis platform.</p>\n\n      <p>WE WILL NEVER SELL, RENT, OR LEASE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION. Please read our Privacy Policy for more information.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"trends\">\n      <h3>Data Use & Trends</h3>\f\n\n      <p>This is your data. You’ll be able to view your symptoms, triggers, medication adherence (if you track them), your activities, and data trends on the app.</p>\n\n      <p>We will analyze the combined coded study data. We will look for patterns. These patterns may help us better understand the symptoms of PD. Also, we will investigate how mobile phones and sensors perform in this type of research. Our goal is to improve the quality of life for people with PD.</p>\n\n      <p>We will not use the coded study data for commercial advertising.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"sharing\">\n      <h3>Sharing For Future Research</h3>\n\n      <p>The same coded study data that you donate for mPower Progression study could be used for other research. You get to decide if you want to share your coded study data with qualified researchers worldwide. If you give permission, sharing will be done without additional informed consent.</p>\n\n      <p>We have rules to qualify researchers. Qualified researchers must register on Synapse, our data analysis platform. To access the data, qualified researchers must write a short statement about their research. The research could be about any topic. The research could be on topics you disagree with or find offensive. We post the researchers’ statements on Synapse for anyone to read. They must sign an oath to use the data ethically and do no harm.
