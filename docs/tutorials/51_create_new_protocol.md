# Creating a new protocol

## Creating a protocol from scratch

### Setting the stage

We first need to create some folders to host the schema that will represent all our questionnaires.

```bash
# Type this in a terminal window

# FYI: this line starts with #
#  it is comment and it will not be executed
#  if you copy paste it in the command line

# Creating the directory for the depression neuroimaging study
mkdir depression_nimg_schema

# Move into the directory
cd depression_nimg_schema
```

Now let's create the `protocols` folder, a protocol file named after our study.

```bash
# Type this in a terminal window
mkdir protocols
touch protocols/depression_nimg_schema.jsonld
```

Ok so now we are ready to start putting some content into those files.

Open the `depression_nimg_schema.jsonld` with a text editor and add the following content into it.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema/1.0.0-rc1/contexts/generic",
  "@type": "reproschema:Protocol",
  "@id": "depression_nimg_schema.jsonld",
  "prefLabel": "depression neuroimaging study",
  "description": "a study on linguistic processing in depression",
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0-rc1",
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

To explain a bit what all of this means:

- `@context` gives the URL where we can find the "definitions" of terms used in the reproschema. It is itself a json file that you [can view directly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema/1.0.0-rc1/contexts/generic).
- `@type` just says what type of entity this jsonld file describes. In this case it is a `protocol` entity as defined by the reproschema.
- `@id` is the identity of this entity, its unique identifier.

You can then use the preferred label field and the description to give more human readable ways to describe this entity.

You must also specify the version of the schema you are using.

#### Landing page

Let's now take care of adding a landing page to the list of assessments our participants will have to fill in.

Let's create a markdown readme file in the `protocols` folder.

```bash
# Type this in a terminal window
touch protocols/README.md
```

Add some content in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to it just to get things started, like for example

```markdown
# README

Hello world
```

Now we want to add this file to our protocol and make it the landing page for the english version of this study. So the content of your protocol file should now read like this.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema/1.0.0-rc1/contexts/generic",
  "@type": "reproschema:Protocol",
  "@id": "depression_nimg_schema.jsonld",
  "prefLabel": "depression neuroimaging study",
  "description": "a study on linguistic processing in depression",
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0-rc1",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "landingPage": {
    "@id": "README.md",
    "@language": "en"
  }
}
```

??? "A note about relative paths"
    Reproschema allows for the use of relative paths which means that in the example above the landing page `@id` being "README.md" means that the `README.md` and `depression_nimg_schema` are in the same folder. If the `README.md` had been in the parent directory, the `@id` of the `landingPage` section would have read `"@id": "../README.md"`.

### Add a first assessment

OK now we want to add a questionnaire to assess the severity of the depression of our participants.

The first thing to do is to browse through the [library of assessments](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/tree/master/activities) that already exist on the [dedicated repronim repository](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library).

It seems that we can use the [PHQ-9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495268/) that self describes as a "Brief Depression Severity Measure".

The schema that describe the PHQ-9 activity can be found [here](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/blob/master/activities/PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema).

If you want to visualize this activity on its own, you can use the [reproschema-ui](https://www.repronim.org/reproschema-ui/#/). To do that you can point the UI to the **raw** content of this activity.

To get access to the raw content of that activity you must click on the `Raw` button on github once you have opened its [page](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/blob/master/activities/PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema). This will open this URL: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/master/activities/PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/master/activities/PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema).

You can then pass the the URL of raw content to the UI using the following template:

```
https://www.repronim.org/reproschema-ui/#/activities/0?url=url-to-activity-schema
```

So in the case of the PHQ-9, it would give this URL that we copy-paste in a browser to view the activity on its own.

```
https://www.repronim.org/reproschema-ui/#/activities/0?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/master/activities/PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema
```

You should now be able to see something like this and browse directly through the content of the activity.

<img
src="../img/phq-9_ui.png"
alt="phq-9_ui.png"
style="width: 700px; height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;"/>

OK now that we know what we need to add to our protocol, let's add it our schema.

To do this, the content of your `depression_nimg_schema.jsonld` should now look like this.

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema/1.0.0-rc1/contexts/generic",
    {
      "rl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/master/activities/"
    }
  ],
  "@type": "reproschema:Protocol",
  "@id": "depression_nimg_schema.jsonld",
  "prefLabel": "depression neuroimaging study",
  "description": "a study on linguistic processing in depression",
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0-rc1",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "landingPage": {
    "@id": "README.md",
    "@language": "en"
  },
  "ui": {
    "addProperties": [
      {
        "isAbout": "rl:PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema",
        "variableName": "PHQ9_schema",
        "prefLabel": { "en": "Depression" }
      }
    ],
    "order": ["rl:PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema"]
  }
}
```

#### What did we add ?

Let's just highlight the things that have changed.

We have added a `ui` and an `order` fields.

`ui` is for things related to the user interface and contains `addProperties` where we will be listing all the assessments that we add to our protocol.

Each assessment is represented by an activity that is given a `variableName` and a `prefLabel`. The latter will be used as the name to display on the UI in english.

The field `isAbout` is the URL to point to the schema of that activity.

The field `order` is there to indicate which activity should be presented first, second...

??? "Making sure you have a valid json file"
    Json files can get a bit long and you might sometimes forget a coma of a closing square brackets, so to make sure that your json file is correctly formatted you can use a linter. For example, you can test individual files on the [json linter website](`https://jsonlint.com/`).

??? "JSON-LD expansion"
    You might notice that `rl:PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema` does not look like a typical URL and clearly does not match the one we fed the UI earlier (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/master/activities/PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema). Well this is because we have defined, in the `@context` part of our jsonld, that the `rl` from `rl:PHQ-9/PHQ9_schema` will actually stand for `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/master/activities/`. This shorthand makes it faster for us to write URL but the UI will know how to `expand` this into an actual URL.

    Similarly the `reproschema:Protocol` in `"@type": "reproschema:Protocol"` expands in `http://schema.repronim.org/Protocol` because `reproschema` has been indirectly defined in the context of `depression_nimg_schema.jsonld`. To be more precise `reproschema` is defined in the [base file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema/1.0.0-rc1/contexts/base) which is part of the context of the [generic file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReproNim/reproschema/1.0.0-rc1/contexts/generic) that our protocol points to.



#### Starting to put things online to see how they look

So now we want to put things online and see how things look.

To do that we will use Git and Github.

Let's first initialize a repository in the folder where we have have been working.

```bash
# Type this in a terminal window
git init . # the dot signifies the directory where you currently are
```

Now we tell git to make a snapshot of the current state of your folder.

```bash
# Type this in a terminal window
git add --all # tell git to include all the new changes into the next snapshot

git commit -m 'add protocol and README' # make a first snapshot of your protocol
```

Now to move things to a github repository, you need to go and create an empty repository to host the folder and files you have created.

The repository should have an URL that resembles this one where `your_user_name` is your actual Github username:

```
https://github.com/your_user_name/depression_nimg_schema.git
```

You "push" the content of the `depression_nimg_schema` onto the empty "remote" repository you have just created.

```bash
# Type this in a terminal window

# tell git about the existence of this new online repository you have just created
git remote add origin https://github.com/your_user_name/depression_nimg_schema.git

# Transfer the content there
git push -u origin master
```

If everything worked normally, you should be able to use the reproschema-ui to visualize your protocol using the following template:

```
https://www.repronim.org/reproschema-ui/#/?url=url-to-protocol-schema
```

So once again grab the URL of the **raw** content of your protocol and point the UI to it:

```
https://www.repronim.org/reproschema-ui/#/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your_user_name/depression_nimg_schema/master/protocol/depression_nimg_schema.jsonld
```

### In you own time: add the `thank-you` activity

For practice you can now add another activity to your protocol: one to thank people for their participation.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library/tree/master/activities/ThankYou) in the reproschema library.

Once you have changed the `depression_nimg_schema.jsonld`, you can update the online content with the following git commands.

```bash
# Type this in a terminal window
git add --all
git commit -m 'add a thank you activity'
git push
```
