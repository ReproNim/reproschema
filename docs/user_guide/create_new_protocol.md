# Creating a Research Protocol Using Cookiecutter

Ready for your first ReproSchema project?! We are going to use the [Reproschema Protocol Cookiecutter](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-protocol-cookiecutter) to create a demo protocol.

## Getting Started

1. Prerequisite: Ensure you have Git and Cookiecutter installed on your system. If not, please refer to the installation guides for Git and Cookiecutter.
2. Generate Your Repository: Use the Reproschema Protocol Cookiecutter to create a new repository for your research protocol. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:ReproNim/reproschema-protocol-cookiecutter
```

3. Follow the prompts to customize your new protocol, more details see [here](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-protocol-cookiecutter#step-1-generate-the-protocol-files)

## Customizing Your Protocol

Once you run the Cookiecutter command, you will be prompted to make choices for your protocol, ranging from 1-5. These choices generate corresponding activities in your repository. Here's what you can do with these activities:

1. **Use as Templates:** The activities created based on your choices serve as templates. You can use these to understand the structure and elements within the activities folder. This is particularly useful if you're new to ReproSchema. By exploring these templates, you'll get a clearer picture of how activities are structured and what kind of information they contain.
2. **Delete and Start Fresh:** Alternatively, if you already have a clear idea of what your protocol needs, you can delete these generated activities. This allows you to start from scratch, creating activities that are tailored specifically to your research needs.

The inclusion of activity choices aims to provide users with a practical understanding of how activities are structured within ReproSchema protocols. Whether you use these as a starting point or prefer to create your own from the ground up, these templates are there to guide you in structuring your research protocol effectively.

We provide more detailed instructions for customizing your protocol in the following pages using [reproschema-demo-protocol](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-demo-protocol) as an example.
