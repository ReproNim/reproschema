# ReproSchema: Enhancing Research Reproducibility through Standardized Survey Data Collection

The ReproSchema project integrates five key components designed to standardize research protocols and enhance consistency across various stages of data collection.
- Foundational Schema ([reproschema](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema)): This core schema delineates the content and relationships of protocols, assessments, and items to ensure consistency and facilitate data harmonization across studies.
- Assessment Library ([reproschema-library](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-library)): This library provides a comprehensive collection of standardized questionnaires, supporting the application of uniform assessments across time and different studies.
- Python-based CLI Tool ([reproschema-py](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-py)): This command-line interface tool facilitates schema development and validation, aiding researchers in efficiently creating and refining data collection frameworks.
- User Interface ([reproschema-ui](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-ui)): This intuitive user interface simplifies the visualization and interaction with data, enhancing the manageability of the data collection process for researchers.
- Protocol Template ([reproschema-protocol-cookiecutter](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema-protocol-cookiecutter)): This customizable template supports the design and implementation of research protocols tailored to specific study requirements.

### Developer notes
To run the Python scripts in the scripts directory, you will need to install the
following libraries via pip

- reproschema (makeRelease.py)
- pytablewriter (editProperties.py)

To make a new release:

```bash
python scripts/makeRelease.py <version>
python scripts/editProperties.py <version>
```

In addition, this repo uses pre-commit to check styling.

Install: `pip install pre-commit`

Use: run `pre-commit install` in the root directory of the repo.
